# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton that simulates the evolution of a population of cells on a 2D grid. The game consists of a grid of cells, where each cell can either be alive or dead. The game proceeds in generations, with the state of each cell in a generation depending on the state of its neighboring cells in the previous generation.

In this implementation in 3 languages : Python Golang and Rust, the game is animated in the console. Each generation is displayed in the console as a 10x10 grid of cells, with alive cells represented by brackets (`[#]`) and dead cells represented by spaces. The initial state of the grid is randomized, and the game continues indefinitely until it is stopped manually.
